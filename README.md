## Robotic Arm and Its Applications Project

A simple robotic arm with 3 degrees of freedom. It consists of 4 joints, each joint has a servo motor and a potentiometer acts as a motion sensor.
The arm was programmed using c++ and connected to the computer through the parallel port. It performed pick up and placement tasks. It was used in an engineering exhibition to build
a small wall, and it was awarded the best project in that exhibition in the engineers week, University of Khartoum 2005.
